## Getting setup with Scratch
These Sushi Cards are going to help you learn to create computer programs in Scratch. To do this, you’re going to need to have Scratch!

You can either:
 * Download and install Scratch on your computer by going to [dojo.soy/downloadscratch](http://dojo.soy/downloadscratch)
 * Or use it in your web browser by going to [dojo.soy/usescratch](http://dojo.soy/usescratch). Do one of these two and once you’re set up, move on to the next step.
